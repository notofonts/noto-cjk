Note: prior releases of the CJK fonts were issued under the Apache 2
license. This was changed to the SIL OFL v1.1 starting with Version 1.002.

Description:
Noto CJK fonts, supporting Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean. The supported scripts are Han, Hiragana, Katakana,
Hangul, and Bopomofo. Latin, Greek, Cyrllic, and various symbols are also
supported for compatibility with CJK standards.

The fonts in this directory are developed by Google and Adobe and are
released as open source under the Apache license version 2.0. The copyright
is held by Adobe, while the trademarks on the names are held by Google.

Local Modifications:
Windows-specific files have been added to work around a bug in Windows
causing any font with a usWeight value less than 250 to get displayed with a
much heavier weight. They are based on the original OTF files, and are
modified using the nototools/fix_noto_cjk_thin.py script.

A README.formats file has been added explaining the different formats
provided and their features and limitations.
